- Make a register file

- Make a testbench for the register file. It must contain a
signal err that is initialized to 0 and set to 1 if error is found
and stay there thereafter. All tests should finish before t = 500

- do debugging bs, compile in quartus and make sure everything looks
good


- Now do the same for ALU

- Now do the same for the shifter

- now instantiate all in datapath.v and add in the rest of the blocks

- make a tb which should at minimum be able to do mov and add commands
but to get full marks, it should be able to test more complex shit

- test overall in modelsim

- test on de1
